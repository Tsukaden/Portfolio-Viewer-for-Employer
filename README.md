# Portfolio Viewer for Employer

This homework assignment involves developing a basic portfolio viewer that allows employers to review a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples. The purpose is to assess the candidate's skills and suitability for an open position based on their previous work.

## Summary

The portfolio viewer fulfills the following requirements:

- The homepage displays the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about the developer, their work, and contact information.

- Clicking on a navigation link scrolls the UI to the corresponding section, providing easy navigation.

- Clicking on the link to the "Work" section scrolls the UI to a section that showcases titled images of the developer's applications.

- The first application's image is larger in size than the others, drawing attention to it.

- Clicking on an application image redirects to the deployed application, allowing employers to explore the project further.

- The portfolio viewer offers a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.

By implementing these features, the portfolio viewer aims to provide employers with a convenient way to evaluate a potential employee's work samples and make informed decisions when considering them for a job position.
